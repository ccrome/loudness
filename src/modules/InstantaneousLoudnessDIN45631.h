     *
     * @brief Calculates the total loudness from the main loudness according to
     * DIN 45631 (1990).
     *
     * The input SignalBank should have 21 channels corresponding to the
     * approximated critical bands derived from third-octave filter bands.
     * If the input SignalBank has two ears, the loudness in each is computed
     * according to the standard and the sum of loudnesses is divided by two.
     * The output SignalBank of this module has one ear, one channel and one sample.
     *
     * @todo Develop a module for transforming the main loudness to specific
     * loudness.
