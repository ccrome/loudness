    /**
     * @brief Implementation of the DIN 45631:1991 stationary loudness model.
     * 
     * This loudness model is for processing spectra only, i.e. there is no
     * time-frequency decomposition. The input SignalBank can have multiple ears
     * and channels but only one sample per channel. This sample should
     * correspond to the intensity of a single component in normalised units.
     * Make sure that the frequencies corresponding to the input components are
     * set before initialising this model.
     *
     * If the input SignalBank used to initialise this model has one ear, then
     * the instantaneous loudness is calculated for binaural loudness. If the input
     * SignalBank has two ears, the loudness is computed for each ear according
     * to the standard, summed and then divided by two.  
     *
     * The input SignalBank is filtered by a set of 28 third octave band filters
     * (using the third order Butterworth band pass filter response given in ANSI S1.11:1986).
     *
     * OUTPUTS:
     *  - "InstantaneousLoudness"
     *
     * @todo Develop a module for transforming the main loudness to specific
     * loudness.
