    /**
     * @brief Implementation of the Chen et al 2011 stationary loudness model.
     * 
     * This loudness model is for processing spectra only, i.e., there is no
     * time-frequency decomposition. The input SignalBank can have
     * multiple ears and channels but only one sample per channel which
     * specifies the intensity of a single component. Make sure that the centre
     * frequencies corresponding to each input component are set.
     *
     * If the input SignalBank used to initialise this model has one ear, then
     * the instantaneous loudness is multiplied by two. If you don't want this,
     * call method setDioticPresentation(false) (default is true). If the input
     * SignalBank has two ears, the default the instantaneous loudness is a sum
     * of the loudness in both left and right ears. If you want to access the
     * loudness in both left and right ears separately, call method
     * setDioticPresentation(false). When there are two ears, the binaural
     * inhibition model proposed by Moore and Glasberg (2007) is used. If you
     * don't want this call method setInhibitSpecificLoudness(false). 
     *
